The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if the calculation involves units that are not compatible or if the calculation results in an invalid value. For example, trying to subtract a length from a percentage might yield an error.  Another issue is the order of operations within the `calc()` function itself, which might not always be intuitive. Parentheses should be used liberally to ensure intended behavior.  Finally, older browsers may have limited support for the `calc()` function, resulting in rendering inconsistencies.
